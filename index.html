        <p id="ptag" class="myclass">Let's start by creating an ordered list of things I'd like to accomplish for this project :&#41;</p>
        <p>Ready. Set. Go!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add an ordered list.  <input class="checks" type="checkbox" checked/></li>
            <li>Add style to this page. <input class="checks" type="checkbox" checked/></li>
            <li>Add checkmark boxes next to our list items. <input class="checks" type="checkbox" checked/></li>
            <li>Will Ragsook approve this PR?  testing branches and collaboration to see if I can trust him with code reviews</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="demo">before javascript.. Interact with a checkbox to change me</p>
        <button onclick="playMusic()">Free fart</button>

        <p id="ptag" class="myclass">Now my second list of <b>un</b>ordered items that I'd like to accomplish in an upcoming project</p>
        <ul>
          <li href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5x0JCZbAJs">Research React front end development framework</li>
          <li>Create a new github repo to collaborate with RAGSOOK and add him</li>
          <li>Meet with RAGSOOK to start application.  Here are some ideas on what the app could be:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Something music related.  Maybe to start with, we could make something that looks like a piano, and when you click a key, it plays a note</li>
            <li>Maybe add a button or different page to record the end-users voice, and play it back in a different octive?</li>
            <li>Or play it back normal, with the addition of the octive?</li>
            <li>Or play a harmonic of the recording with it back</li>
            <li>Or play a drum beat along with the song?</li>
            <li>Or get the frequency of the voice, and generate a sound board from it?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Figure out how to deploy it in a hosted website?</li>
          <li>Add login functionality?</li>
          <li>Add database functionality?</li>
          <li>Make it a mobile app as well as a browser based app</li>
          <li>Add some back end development or api's</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
    <p>In the meantime, please enjoy this old game that I created in college.  Perhaps I'll be making improvements to it as we progress!</p>
